Crop farming is the practice of growing plants for food, fiber, and other agricultural products. 
The most common crops include grains like wheat, rice, and corn, as well as vegetables, fruits, 
and cash crops like cotton and coffee.

Successful crop farming requires understanding soil conditions, climate patterns, and proper 
irrigation techniques. Farmers must select appropriate crop varieties for their region and 
manage pests and diseases effectively.

Key factors in crop production include:
- Soil preparation and fertility management
- Seed selection and planting techniques
- Water management and irrigation systems
- Fertilizer application and nutrient management
- Pest and disease control
- Harvest timing and post-harvest handling

Modern agriculture also incorporates precision farming techniques using technology to optimize 
yields while minimizing environmental impact. Crop rotation and cover crops help maintain soil 
health and prevent erosion.
