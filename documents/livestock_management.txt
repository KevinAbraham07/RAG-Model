Livestock farming involves raising animals for meat, milk, eggs, wool, and other products. 
Common livestock includes cattle, pigs, sheep, goats, chickens, and ducks.

Proper livestock management requires attention to animal health, nutrition, housing, and 
welfare. Farmers must provide adequate feed, clean water, shelter, and veterinary care.

Key aspects of livestock management include:
- Breeding and genetics for improved productivity
- Nutrition and feed management
- Disease prevention and veterinary care
- Housing and environmental conditions
- Animal welfare and ethical practices
- Waste management and environmental impact

Sustainable livestock farming focuses on efficient resource use, animal welfare, and 
minimizing environmental footprint. Pasture-based systems and rotational grazing can improve 
soil health while providing natural feed for animals.
