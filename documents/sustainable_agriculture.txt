Sustainable agriculture is a farming approach that focuses on long-term environmental health, 
economic profitability, and social equity. It aims to meet current food needs without 
compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.

Sustainable farming practices include:
- Organic farming methods that avoid synthetic pesticides and fertilizers
- Crop rotation and diversification to maintain soil health
- Integrated pest management (IPM) to reduce chemical use
- Water conservation and efficient irrigation systems
- Conservation tillage to reduce soil erosion
- Agroforestry combining trees with crops or livestock
- Renewable energy use on farms

Benefits of sustainable agriculture include:
- Improved soil health and fertility over time
- Reduced environmental pollution
- Enhanced biodiversity
- Better water quality and conservation
- Increased resilience to climate change
- Economic stability for farmers
- Healthier food products

Modern sustainable agriculture often combines traditional knowledge with innovative 
technologies like precision farming, renewable energy, and biological pest control methods.
